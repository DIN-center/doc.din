# `eth_getFilterChanges`

Polling method for a filter, which returns an array of logs which occurred since the last poll.

Filter must be created by calling either `eth_newFilter` or `eth_newBlockFilter`.

## Parameters

- `filter ID`: (string) _[required]_ - A string denoting the filter ID.

## Returns

- `log object array`: An array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since the last poll.
- For filters created with `eth_newBlockFilter` the return values are block hashes (32 bytes), for example, `["0x3454645634534..."]`.
- For filters created with `eth_newFilter` the logs are objects with the following params:
  - `address`: 20 bytes - Address from which this log originated.
  - `blockHash`: 32 bytes - The hash of the block where this log was in. `null` when it is a pending log.
  - `blockNumber`: The block number where this log was in. `null` when it is a pending log.
  - `data`: Contains the non-indexed arguments of the log.
  - `logIndex`: A hexadecimal of the log index position in the block. `null` when it is a pending log.
  - `removed`: `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. `false` if it is a valid log.
  - `topics`: Array of data - An array of 0 to 4 32-bytes data of indexed log arguments. In Solidity the first `topic` is the hash of the signature of the event (for example, `Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)`), except when you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.
  - `transactionHash`: 32 bytes - A hash of the transactions from which this log was created. `null` when it is a pending log.
  - `transactionIndex`: A hexadecimal of the transactions index position from which this log was created. `null` when it is a pending log.
