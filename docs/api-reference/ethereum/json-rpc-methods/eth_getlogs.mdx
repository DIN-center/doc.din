# `eth_getlogs`


Returns an array of all the logs matching the given filter object. See also the below [Constraints](#constraints) section. 

## Parameters

- `filter object`: (object) _[required]_ - A filter object containing the following:
  - `address`: (string or array) _[optional]_ - Contract address (20 bytes) or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
  - `fromBlock`: (string) _[optional, default is "latest"]_ - A hexadecimal block number, or one of the string tags `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`, `safe`, or `finalized`. See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).
  - `toBlock`: (string) _[optional, default is "latest"]_ - A hexadecimal block number, or one of the string tags `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`, `safe`, or `finalized`. See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).
  - `topics`: (array) _[optional]_ - Array of 32 bytes DATA topics. Topics are order-dependent.
  - `blockhash`: (string) _[optional]_ - Restricts the logs returned to the single block referenced in the 32-byte hash `blockHash`. Using `blockHash` is equivalent to setting `fromBlock` and `toBlock` to the block number referenced in the `blockHash`. If `blockHash` is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

## Returns

An array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since the last poll. Log objects contain the following keys and their values:

- `removed` - `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. `false` if it's a valid log.
- `logIndex` - Hexadecimal of the log index position in the block. `Null` when it is a pending log.
- `transactionIndex` - Hexadecimal of the transactions index position from which the log created. `Null` when it is a pending log.
- `transactionHash` - Hash of the transactions from which this log was created (32 bytes). `Null` when it is a pending log.
- `blockHash` - Hash of the block where this log was in (32 bytes). `Null` when it is a pending log.
- `blockNumber` - Block number where this log was in. `Null` when it is a pending log.
- `address` - Address from which this log originated (20 bytes).
- `data` - Contains one or more 32-bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
- `topics` - An array of 0 to 4 indexed log arguments, each 32 bytes. In solidity the first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (for example, `Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)`), except when you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.

## Constraints

The following constraints apply:

To prevent queries from consuming too many resources, `eth_getLogs` requests are currently limited by three constraints:

- A maximum of 5,000 parameters in a single request
- A maximum of 10,000 results can be returned by a single query
- Query duration must not exceed 10 seconds

If a query returns too many results or exceeds the max query duration, one of the following errors is returned:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32005,
    "message": "query returned more than 10000 results"
  }
}
```

or

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32005,
    "message": "query timeout exceeded"
  }
}
```

If this happens:

- Limit your query to a smaller number of blocks using `fromBlock` and `toBlock`.
- If querying for commonly used `topics`, consider limiting to a single smart contract `address`.
