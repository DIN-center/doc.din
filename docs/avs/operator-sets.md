# Operator sets

EigenLayer operator sets have been discussed and designed at length to create more granular roles and permissions for EigenLayer operators and AVS design.
For DIN as an AVS, this would mean the node providers would be able to join EigenLayer restaking and specifically be identified for watchers to stake or slash.
Each operator set will need to represent a specific serviceâ€”for example, the watcher service or Ethereum Holesky testnet.
