# Slashing and rewards

The AVS model within DIN provides structured incentives that reward high-performing node providers and watchers while penalizing those who fail to meet expectations.
This incentive structure ensures the network's sustainability and aligns participant behavior with DIN's quality standards.

## Performance-based rewards

- **Additional rewards for SLA compliance** - Node providers and watchers who consistently meet or exceed SLA standards receive additional token rewards.
  These rewards, distributed through the gateway contract, encourage participants to prioritize performance and reliability.

- **Reputation-linked incentives** - As AVS supports a reputation system, operators with high SLA compliance scores can attract more request routing, maximizing their earning potential while reinforcing a culture of quality service.

## Deterrents for underperformance

- **Incremental slashing for repeated violations** - AVS implements a tiered slashing system, where penalties increase in severity for operators with repeated SLA violations.
  This graduated approach encourages operators to rectify issues promptly, reducing long-term service disruptions.

- **Suspension and removal for persistent non-compliance** - Node providers with chronic performance issues face suspension or removal from the network, ensuring that DIN maintains only reliable and committed participants.
