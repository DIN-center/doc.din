# Veto Committee

The DIN Veto Committee is comprised of the seven highest performing node providers over a 14.5 day period (an epoch).
Performance is measured as total successful requests served over an epoch.
This is directly proportional to the rewards earned over the epoch.
If a provider is slashed during the prior epoch, they are still eligible to be part of the Veto Committee.

[Hats protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/) is used to assign the role of a Veto Committee member, to timebox membership, and to revoke the role in the event of non-participation.

The DIN Veto Committee has a process to review slashing scenarios with shared opinions in the **#din-general** Slack channel.
