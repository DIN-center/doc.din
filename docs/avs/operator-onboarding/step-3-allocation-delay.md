## What is Allocation Delay?

The time between staking tokens and when they become slashable. This is **customizable** on both testnet and mainnet.

:::info Important
This is different from the 17-day wallet age requirement for mainnet. The allocation delay is your choice for operational safety.

Most operators use 0 (immediate) for flexibility.
