# Step 3: Set allocation delay

Configure the allocation delay that determines when your stake becomes active for slashing.

Allocation delay is the time between staking tokens and when they become slashable. This is customizable
on both testnet and mainnet.

:::warning Important
This is different to the 17-day wait period for your wallet to become active on EigenLayer, for mainnet.
The allocation delay is your choice for operational safety and is in addition to the 17-day wait period.
