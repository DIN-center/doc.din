# Onboard using the DIN app

Follow these steps to onboard as a DIN AVS operator using the [DIN app](https://app.din.build).
Complete each step in order to successfully register and begin serving traffic.

Ensure you've reviewed the [prerequisites](../prerequisites.md) before continuing with the onboarding
process.

## Required steps

1. **[Register as an EigenLayer operator](./register-operator.md)** - Register your
   operator address with EigenLayer's delegation manager contract. This establishes your
   identity as an operator on the EigenLayer protocol.

2. **[Stake tokens](./stake-tokens.md)** - Stake the required tokens (stETH, WETH, etc.) into EigenLayer strategies. This provides the economic security backing for your operator services.

3. **[Set the allocation delay](./allocation-delay.md)** - Configure the allocation delay for your staked assets. This determines when your stake becomes active for slashing conditions.

4. **[Watcher setup](./watchers.md)** (Coming soon) - Configure watcher services to monitor your operator performance. Currently in development.

5. **[Allocate stake to operator sets](./opt-in-avs.md)** - Final registration step to join the DIN AVS and begin serving traffic.
