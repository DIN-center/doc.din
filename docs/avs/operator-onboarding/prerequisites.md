# Prerequisites

Before starting the [onboarding process](./onboard/) using the [DIN app](https://app.din.build), ensure you have the following ready:

## Wallet requirements

Compatible wallets include MetaMask and WalletConnect. DIN supports
[multiple wallet setup options](./mainnet-preparation.md#wallet-setup-options).

:::danger Critical for Mainnet
Your wallet MUST be dedicated exclusively to DIN AVS. Using a wallet associated with another AVS will cause operational failures.
:::

### Mainnet

- [ ] **Brand new externally owned account (EOA) wallet** - Never used with any other EigenLayer AVS
- [ ] **Dedicated to DIN only** - Cannot be shared with other EigenLayer AVS operations

:::warning Mainnet Launch - November 14th, 2025
DIN AVS is launching on mainnet soon! Operators must begin onboarding with their wallets **immediately**
due to a 17-day operator allocation delay. October 27, 2025 is the absolute latest to create your wallet
and onboard in time for mainnet launch.
:::

### Testnet

- [ ] Any wallet works for testing

## Financial requirements

- [ ] **Minimum 1 ETH** in your wallet (EigenLayer recommendation)
- [ ] Stake amounts will be calculated during [Step 2](./onboard/stake-tokens.md) based on your operator sets

**Current strategies:**

- stETH (Lido Staked ETH)
- WETH (Wrapped ETH)

*Additional strategies will be available after launch.*

## Technical requirements

- [ ] **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Brave (latest version)
- [ ] **Stable internet** for transaction signing
- [ ] **Pop-ups enabled** for app.din.build

## Account access

- [ ] Account at [app.din.build](https://app.din.build)
- [ ] Email verification completed
- [ ] Access to DIN's TXTX onboarding (automatic during onboarding)

## Operator requirements

Before proceeding, understand:

- [ ] What [operator sets](../operator-sets.md) you'll be serving
- [ ] The [slashing conditions](../slashing-and-rewards.md) for the AVS
- [ ] Performance requirements (â‰¥ 99.9% uptime)
- [ ] There's a 17-day wait for your registered wallet ([step 1](./onboard/register-operator.md)) to become
    eligible for rewards and slashing on EigenLayer.

## Ready to start?

If all prerequisites are met, review the [mainnet launch](./mainnet-preparation.md) instructions,
then begin with [Step 1: Register as Operator](./onboard/register-operator.md).
