# AVS Economics

The AVS model within DIN provides structured incentives that reward high-performing Node Operators and Watchers while penalizing those who fail to meet expectations. This incentive structure ensures the network's sustainability and aligns participant behavior with DIN's quality standards.

## Performance-Based Rewards

- **Additional Rewards for SLA Compliance**: Operators and Watchers who consistently meet or exceed SLA standards receive additional token rewards. These rewards, distributed through the Gateway Contract, encourage participants to prioritize performance and reliability.

- **Reputation-Linked Incentives**: As AVS supports a reputation system, operators with high SLA compliance scores can attract more request routing, maximizing their earning potential while reinforcing a culture of quality service.

## Deterrents for Underperformance

- **Incremental Slashing for Repeated Violations**: AVS implements a tiered slashing system, where penalties increase in severity for operators with repeated SLA violations. This graduated approach encourages operators to rectify issues promptly, reducing long-term service disruptions.

- **Suspension and Removal for Persistent Non-Compliance**: Operators with chronic performance issues face suspension or removal from the network, ensuring that DIN maintains only reliable and committed participants.
