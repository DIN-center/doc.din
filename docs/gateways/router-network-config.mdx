# DIN Router network configuration

An Ingress Operator will choose between different registered networks/chains and their set technical requirements (e.g. methods, RPS, volume, advanced methods). The full list of these available networks and requirements has not been rendered into a web application, but we can use the Infura documentation as a starting point for which networks and methods are supported. 

## Network selection

### How do I select which available networks (mainnet and testnet) where I can be added to requests?

#### Is this the caddy file?
**Answer:** The DIN team is able to provide a list of available networks where requests can be sent. This list will typically only include networks that are "production-ready" - they can receive requests at an RPS in the thousands. Sometimes, we will make available networks that are in pre-production, largely for integration purposes and for some testing.

#### Is there a list of these chains?
**Answer:** The DIN team keeps a list of supported chains that are available for your consumption.

#### Do I hardcode it on my side? The router side?
**Answer:** You will hardcode a reference to the relevant DIN router endpoint for each network you are consuming within your routing logic.

#### How can I change this?
**Answer:** You will likely not need to change the DIN endpoints, but in the event you do, you will be responsible for changing to any new DIN endpoints that are provided to you.

### What are the expected methods available for each of the DIN Provider networks?
**Answer:** The DIN team will provide a list of methods for each supported chain.

### Can I set any routing preferences for this particular chain?
**Answer:** Potentially, if you have specific routing preferences you will work with the DIN team to see if these preferences can be implemented.
