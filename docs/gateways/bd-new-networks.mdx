title: BD and new networks
---

The addition of new networks to the DIN Router has mainly been determined by the analytics and data from the Infura and MetaMask teams. We have also been approached by large foundations that provide bounties to improve the availability of API services and increase the surface area of builders notified of the network access.

How are new networks determined and prioritized for DIN?
Can we suggest networks if we have sufficient volume?
Answer: Yes! Please suggest networks
Do you directly speak with the foundations? Do you need recommendations?
Answer: We do! We can also use recommendations if you have them
What are the new networks in the DIN pipeline (e.g. considered, negotiating, actively developing, launch date confirmed)?
How can I stay updated with the new networks that are available on DIN? 
Answer: Via attending our bi-weekly DIN Open Hours and Town Halls. We will also let you know as well when new networks are going live.
