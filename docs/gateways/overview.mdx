# DIN Gateway Product Overview

DIN Web3 Gateways will be able to:

1. Authenticate with the DIN Router using the DIN Authentication Protocol
2. Request and receive access to services available on the DIN Router
3. Consume the OpenTelemetry Collector from the DIN Router for ONLY the services the Gateway is accessing AND ONLY for the requests that are coming from that specific Gateway
   - Note: these statistics are used for manual payment invoices through Consensys Software, Inc.
4. Receive data from the Watcher (CompareNodes) in order to serve as an additional verification on the requests served by the DIN Router to the Gateway
5. Implement session ID to ensure consistency of responses
6. Access the DIN Observability Dashboard (includes the OpenTelemetry Collector data)
   - The Gateways will need to be able to ONLY consume the telemetry associated with the networks they are consuming and ONLY for the requests coming from that specific Gateway.
   - (Directly share JSON file if they're using Signoz)
7. Use open channels to raise any technical issues
   - (Possible Incident bot on Slack)
