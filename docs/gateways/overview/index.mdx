DIN Gateway Product Overview
DIN Web3 Gateways will be able to:

Consume the OpenTelemetry Collector from the DIN Router for ONLY the services the Gateway is accessing AND ONLY for the requests that are coming from that specific Gateway

Receive data from the Watcher (CompareNodes) in order to serve as an additional verification on the requests served by the DIN Router to the Gateway
Implement session ID to ensure consistency of responses

The Gateways will need to be able to ONLY consume the telemetry associated with the networks they are consuming and ONLY for the requests coming from that specific Gateway.
