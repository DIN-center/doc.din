# Troubleshooting

Infura has created a number of tools and processes with runbooks that help us respond to incidents. Most of these are implemented policies and communication channels. If this has not been created already, the DIN team will have an open slack channel dedicated to supporting the Gateway onboarding and troubleshooting process.

## Common Issues

### What if we receive empty or wrong data from DIN?
**Answer:** Reach out to us on our dedicated Slack channel. We will be enforcing "Slashing" for deviations from expected behavior.

### What if the DIN Router goes down?
**Answer:** Alert us immediately.

### Who do we report this information to from the DIN team?
**Answer:** Reach out to us on our dedicated Slack channel.
