# Introduction

## What is DIN?

ðŸ’¡ DIN's vision is to be a decentralized B2B service discovery marketplace, enhancing the performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of dapp development through a network of 50+ Web3 Infrastructure providers. DIN is capable of serving 14+ popular blockchain network APIs and RPCs with high throughput and performance with no single point of failure. DIN is currently in a federated phase, progressively decentralizing traffic across Infura and MetaMask.

Today, DIN is a live Decentralized RPC-as-a-Service marketplace that allows centralized RPC providers (like Infura) to offer developers API access to highly-available, reliable endpoints and performant blockchain infrastructure for 14+ networks (e.g. Linea, Blast, Swellchain, Unichain, see full list of networks) deemed valuable by the users they serve.

## What is DIN as an AVS?

DIN is building with the EigenLayer ecosystem to integrate the onboarding and incentive structures behind our Node Provider, Watcher, and Web3 Gateway participants. DIN as an AVS is the missing decentralized administration piece to manage our DIN router identities, reputation, and network endpoints.

## Solving for the RPC trilemma

Maintaining sustainable pricing has become increasingly challenging as the infrastructure grows more complex. With the need to balance intensive computational demands, high availability, and rapid scaling, RPC providers face substantial cost pressures in an industry where price competitiveness is often paramount.

## Core principles

DIN's foundational values are:

- **Decentralization** â€“ Removing reliance on a single authority for infrastructure provisioning. Improving reliability and access for self-sovereign values across MetaMask.
- **Competitive Collaboration with Partners** â€“ Actively working with considered traditional competitors to Infura in order to build a marketplace that increases access and decreases costs across the Web3 Infrastructure ecosystem.
- **Scalability and Resilience** â€“ DIN is designed to handle growing demand via distributed nodes and partnerships with lesser known experts in the blockchain infrastructure space.
