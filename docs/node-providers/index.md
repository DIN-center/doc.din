# Node providers

A node provider runs blockchain nodes and exposes API endpoints that DIN can route traffic to.
Node providers are incentivized for providing high-quality, reliable, and secure services to DIN users
via [web3 gateways](../web3-gateways/index.md).

Node providers earn fiat, stablecoins, or other tokens for hosting nodes in DIN.
They are added to a Network-Services list so the DIN Router can effectively direct traffic and keep track of all relays.
