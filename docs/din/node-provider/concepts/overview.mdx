# Node provider

A node provider runs blockchain nodes and exposes API endpoints that DIN can route traffic to.
DIN providers are incentivized for providing high-quality, reliable, and secure services to DIN users
via Gateways.

TODO:
Add more information about:
- the node provider responsibilities.
- How to join the DIN network as a node provider.
- Watchers monitor the node provider.
- Node provider rewards and slashing
- architecture diagram showing the role of the node provider within DIN
