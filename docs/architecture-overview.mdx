# Architecture Overview

DIN utilizes a decentralized structure composed of multiple actors:

- **DIN Provider Nodes (Node Operators)** - Node operators for different networks will serve traffic via the DIN router. These Providers will be compensated for their fulfilled traffic.
- **DIN Watcher** - Entities that monitor the health of the network traffic. The dashboard will be a source of truth for the processed requests by DIN Providers.
- **DIN Web3 Gateways / Consumers of DIN Services** - Any Provider that wishes to connect to DIN Nodes and pay for processing traffic from DIN Providers
- **Web3 Customers** - These individuals or companies interact directly with Web3 Gateways through their provided identities and processes. They receive services and pay for SLAs covered by the Web3 Gateways

## Key DIN Components

- **DIN Router** - Consists of multiple components, but effectively has a service registry that routes traffic properly between consumers and providers.
- **DIN Payments** - Mechanisms for paying from provider-to-provider related to the successfully processed transactions and APIs.
- **Staking Contracts** - Enforce economic accountability.
- **Performance Monitoring Systems** - Ensure SLA compliance.
- **Smart Contracts** - Manage node registration, network mapping, payment, and governance.

## How DIN Works

DIN operates through a multi-layered, decentralized infrastructure that ensures robust, scalable, and efficient blockchain API services. The core layers include:

### 1. Request Routing Layer

- Web3 Gateway API requests are routed through the DIN Router, which dynamically selects an optimal Node Operator based on performance, load balancing, reputation, and network proximity.
- The DIN Router prioritizes responses from node operators with high uptime and low latency, ensuring an efficient service experience.

### 2. Infrastructure & Validation Layer

- Node Operators provide the fundamental infrastructure by running blockchain nodes and handling API requests based on the provided technical specifications.
- Network Watchers independently listen to open telemetry data from the DIN Router and validates responses, checking for correctness, latency, and uptime.
- Performance metrics are continuously recorded and used for staking rewards and penalties managed through the AVS.

### 3. Economic Security & Staking Layer - DIN as an AVS

- Staking Contracts manage the economic incentives of DIN, requiring node operators and watchers to stake assets to participate. We leverage the AVS deployment to cover the staking rewards and penalties.
- The EigenLayer Integration ensures that nodes with poor performance are economically penalized via slashing/jailing mechanisms, while high-performing nodes receive greater rewards.
- **Slashing Conditions**: If an operator repeatedly fails to meet SLA standards, a portion of their staked tokens is slashed.

### 4. Governance & Automation Layer (Future State)

- DIN operates under a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, allowing stakeholders to vote on key protocol updates and economic parameters.
- Smart Contracts automate governance proposals, ensuring transparency and trustless decision-making.
- Governance controls key aspects, including staking requirements, node licensing, and fee structures.

### 5. Payment & Settlement Layer

- DIN uses an on-chain payment system, enabling transparent, automated transactions between API Web3 Gateways and DIN Providers.
- **Subscription & Pay-as-you-go Models**: DIN Web3 Gateways use pay-per-request via smart contracts to stream data to different DIN Providers.
- Reward distribution follows a performance-based model, ensuring high-quality services.

By structuring its architecture in this modular way, DIN ensures that blockchain API services remain decentralized, reliable, and economically secure while supporting seamless scaling across multiple blockchain networks.
