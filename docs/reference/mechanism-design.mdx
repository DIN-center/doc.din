# Mechanism Design

DIN is built on a carefully structured economic model that aligns incentives across Node Operators, Network Watchers, Web3 Gateways, and other stakeholders to ensure a high-performing, reliable, and secure infrastructure. The mechanism design of DIN combines economic rewards, slashing penalties, and governance controls to promote network stability and incentivize compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs). The incentivized testnet serves as a proving ground, allowing DIN to test and refine these mechanisms in a controlled environment before mainnet deployment.

DIN's mechanism design aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where each participant's actions are economically aligned with network goals. This approach ensures that service quality, security, and scalability are maintained, benefiting both users and operators within the network.

## Economic Alignment through Staking and Slashing

Each Node Operator and Watcher is required to stake tokens, creating a direct economic link between their performance and their financial stake. The staking requirement ensures that all participants have "skin in the game," while slashing mechanisms deter non-compliance by penalizing SLA breaches.

The staking model is structured to scale with operator capacity and anticipated request load, ensuring that larger and higher-stakes operators are proportionally accountable to DIN's performance standards.

- **Staking Requirements**: Node Operators and Watchers are required to stake tokens based on their anticipated service level and workload. This stake serves as collateral, aligning their financial interests with the performance standards set by DIN's SLAs.

- **Slashing Penalties**: The AVS system enforces slashing penalties for operators who fail to meet SLA requirements. Slashing events can be triggered by prolonged downtime, invalid responses, or repeated breaches in data freshness or availability. By imposing financial penalties for non-compliance, DIN incentivizes operators to maintain high standards.

- **Partial and Full Slashing**: The slashing mechanism includes both partial and full penalties, depending on the severity of the SLA violation. Minor infractions may result in partial slashing, while chronic or severe breaches can trigger full slashing, leading to significant financial loss and potential removal from the network.

## Performance-Based Rewards

DIN incentivizes high-quality service by distributing rewards based on compliance with SLAs, request throughput, and overall performance metrics. Operators and Watchers earn token rewards for meeting SLA requirements, while those who exceed benchmarks may earn additional performance-based incentives.

This reward system promotes reliable service, encourages efficient load management, and reinforces the importance of maintaining consistent uptime and data accuracy.

- **SLA Compliance Rewards**: Operators who consistently meet SLA standards receive token rewards that are proportional to their level of activity and compliance history. These rewards encourage reliable performance and incentivize operators to uphold DIN's quality standards.

- **High-Performance Bonuses**: In addition to base rewards, DIN offers bonuses to operators who exceed SLA benchmarks, such as maintaining near-perfect uptime or exceptionally low response times. These high-performance bonuses attract experienced operators who aim to maximize their earnings by delivering premium service quality.

- **Reputation-Linked Incentives**: A reputation system tracks each operator's performance history, with higher reputation scores translating to increased request routing and priority. This reputation-based approach helps users select operators based on demonstrated reliability, further incentivizing operators to build and maintain high-performance records.

## Transparency and Accountability through AVS and DAO Governance

EigenLayer's Actively Validated Service (AVS) model is integrated into DIN's economic model, automating the enforcement of SLAs and ensuring real-time monitoring of operator performance. The AVS system enables automated penalties and rewards, ensuring transparency in the enforcement of network standards.

The DIN DAO oversees all critical economic policies, including staking thresholds, reward structures, and performance metrics, ensuring these mechanisms evolve based on community input and operational data.

- **Token-Based Voting Rights**: Token holders who stake within the DIN DAO gain voting rights proportional to their stake. This voting power allows them to participate in governance decisions, including updates to SLA standards, adjustments to staking requirements, and changes to reward allocations.

- **Proposal Incentives**: The DAO encourages stakeholders to submit governance proposals that align with network goals. Contributors whose proposals are accepted may receive governance rewards, fostering a collaborative environment where the community actively contributes to DIN's evolution.
